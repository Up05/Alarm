# Alarm
This is an alarm cli made for convenience and interoperability.

*If interoperability is the not the right word, oops, I mean: (ability to be built upon by other software made by anyone).*

# Getting started

0. Install Windows
1. Install it. 
2. Restart your computer or run the server/backend.
3. Open your console of choice
4. type: `alarm -a <time> <name>` to add a new alarm, or `alarm` for more information.

# Installation

Anyways,
